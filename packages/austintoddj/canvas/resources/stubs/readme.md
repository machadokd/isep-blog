# Building with Canvas (headless guide)

Canvas is a **headless publishing package** for Laravel. Authors write in the admin SPA (`/canvas` by default). Readers never have to use that UI — you own the public surface.

This guide is for host-app developers who want to:

- Publish the optional starter reader (**Canvas UI**)
- Query posts, tags, topics, and authors from Eloquent
- Render post bodies safely (HTML, images, embeds)
- Integrate via webhooks instead of (or in addition to) polling
- Understand how the **admin JSON API** differs from the public reader path

It lives next to the `canvas:ui` stubs on purpose: Canvas UI is optional; this doc is the companion for that path and for fully custom frontends.

## Mental model

| Layer              | What it is                                                | Who uses it                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Admin SPA**      | React app at `/{canvas.path}` (default `/canvas`)         | Authors, editors, admins               |
| **Admin JSON API** | Authenticated routes under `/{path}/api/*`                | The SPA only (session + Canvas access) |
| **Data layer**     | Eloquent models (`Post`, `Tag`, `Topic`, `CanvasUser`, …) | Your reader, API, jobs, Tinker         |
| **Canvas UI**      | Optional Blade starter at `/canvas-ui`                    | Demo blog or starting point            |
| **Webhooks**       | Outbound HTTPS on public lifecycle events                 | Zapier, CDN purge, your API            |

**Headless rule:** the source of truth for published content is the **database**, not the admin UI. Your frontend should read models (or a host API you build on top of them). Do not call the admin JSON API from the public site — it requires login and Canvas authorization.

## Quick start: optional Canvas UI

```bash
php artisan canvas:ui
```

That command:

1. Publishes Blade views (`resources/views/vendor/canvas/ui` when customized, otherwise package views)
2. Copies a controller stub → `app/Http/Controllers/Canvas/CanvasUiController.php`
3. Copies routes → `routes/canvas-ui.php`
4. Appends `require __DIR__.'/canvas-ui.php';` to `routes/web.php` if missing

Then open **`/canvas-ui`**.

Use `--force` to overwrite previously published views/controller.

| Route name                    | Path                                   | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `canvas-ui.index`             | `/canvas-ui`                           | Paginated published posts                      |
| `canvas-ui.show`              | `/canvas-ui/{slug}`                    | Single post (+ view/visit tracking middleware) |
| `canvas-ui.feed`              | `/canvas-ui/feed`                      | RSS                                            |
| `canvas-ui.tags` / `.tag`     | `/canvas-ui/tags`, `…/tags/{slug}`     | Tag index / archive                            |
| `canvas-ui.topics` / `.topic` | `/canvas-ui/topics`, `…/topics/{slug}` | Topic index / archive                          |
| `canvas-ui.author`            | `/canvas-ui/@{username}`               | Author archive (`canvas_users.username`)       |

The controller stub is intentionally thin: Eloquent queries + views + `PostViewed` on show. Treat it as a template you own after publish.

---

## Querying content (the headless way)

Prefer Eloquent in your host app. Models live under `Canvas\Models\`.

### Published posts

```php
use Canvas\Models\Post;

$posts = Post::published()
    ->with(['user', 'topic', 'tags'])
    ->latest()
    ->paginate();

$post = Post::published()
    ->with(['user', 'tags', 'topic'])
    ->firstWhere('slug', $slug); // or abort 404
```

| Scope               | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Post::published()` | `published_at` is set and **≤ now**                                |
| `Post::draft()`     | No `published_at`, or `published_at` **in the future** (scheduled) |

Scheduled posts are **draft** until their time passes. There is no separate “scheduled” scope; time is the gate.

### Important fields on `Post`

| Column / attribute       | Notes                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                     | UUID string (not auto-increment)                                        |
| `slug`                   | Unique per `user_id`                                                    |
| `title`, `summary`       | Plain text                                                              |
| `body`                   | **HTML** from the TipTap editor (see [Post body HTML](#post-body-html)) |
| `published_at`           | `null` = draft; future = scheduled; past/now = live                     |
| `featured_image`         | URL or root-relative `/storage/…` path                                  |
| `featured_image_caption` | Alt / caption                                                           |
| `meta`                   | JSON SEO bag (`title`, `description`, `canonical_link`, …)              |
| `pending`                | JSON blob of **unpublished edits** on a live post (editor only)         |
| `read_time`              | Appended attribute from body length                                     |
| `has_pending_changes`    | Whether `pending` is non-empty                                          |
| `user_id`                | Host user id (`config('canvas.user_model')`)                            |
| `topic_id`               | Optional topic                                                          |

**Live snapshot vs pending:** Once a post is published, ordinary admin autosaves write **`pending` only** and leave public columns alone. Readers must use the live columns (`title`, `body`, …), not `pending`. Promote/publish in the admin is what merges pending into the public snapshot.

### Tags, topics, authors

```php
use Canvas\Models\Tag;
use Canvas\Models\Topic;
use Canvas\Models\CanvasUser;

$tag = Tag::firstWhere('slug', $slug);
$posts = $tag->posts()->published()->with(['user', 'topic'])->latest()->paginate();

$topic = Topic::firstWhere('slug', $slug);
$posts = $topic->posts()->published()->with(['user', 'tags'])->latest()->paginate();

// Author profile + posts (username is on canvas_users, not the host users table)
$canvasUser = CanvasUser::query()->where('username', $username)->firstOrFail();
$posts = Post::query()
    ->where('user_id', $canvasUser->user_id)
    ->published()
    ->latest()
    ->paginate();
```

Attach Canvas profile data to host users when rendering bylines (the UI controller stub does this with a small helper). Useful fields on `CanvasUser`: `username`, `summary`, `avatar`, `website`, `social`, `locale`, `timezone`, `role`.

### SEO helpers

```php
use Canvas\Support\PostSeo;

$seo = PostSeo::resolve($post, url()->current());
// title, description, canonical_url, image_url, image_alt
```

Canvas UI’s show view uses this for meta tags and JSON-LD. Reuse it in a custom frontend.

### Analytics (optional)

On the public show route, the starter fires:

```php
event(new \Canvas\Events\PostViewed(
    post: $post,
    ip: request()->ip(),
    agent: request()->userAgent(),
    referer: request()->header('referer'),
));
```

`Canvas\Http\Middleware\Session` (applied on `canvas-ui.show`) prunes stale view/visit session keys so counts stay sensible. If you build your own show route and want Canvas stats, fire `PostViewed` the same way and apply similar session hygiene.

---

## Post body HTML

`post.body` is **HTML**, not Markdown. The admin editor (TipTap) produces a constrained subset of tags. That HTML is what you store and what readers should receive.

### Principles

1. **Body is the public contract** — not the admin CSS, not ProseMirror chrome.
2. Render with your design system; Canvas UI’s Tailwind/`prose` classes are only a starter.
3. Trust level: body is written by authenticated Canvas users, not anonymous visitors. Still escape titles/summaries; body is intentionally unescaped HTML (`{!! $post->body !!}` in Blade).
4. Prefer **data attributes** and real iframe `src` values over Canvas-private class names when styling embeds.

### Common block types

| Content                             | Typical markup                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes | Standard HTML (`p`, `h1`–`h3`, `ul`/`ol`, `blockquote`, …)                                            |
| Links                               | `a` with `href`                                                                                       |
| Images                              | `img.canvas-post-body-image` (often root-relative `/storage/…`)                                       |
| Unsplash credit                     | following `p.canvas-post-body-image-credit`                                                           |
| Code                                | `pre.canvas-post-body-code` / `code`                                                                  |
| Tables                              | `table.canvas-post-body-table`                                                                        |
| Audio                               | `audio.canvas-post-body-audio` with `controls`                                                        |
| YouTube                             | `div[data-youtube-video] > iframe` (usually youtube-nocookie embed URL)                               |
| Vimeo / generic video               | `div[data-canvas-iframe][data-layout="video"] > iframe`                                               |
| X / Twitter cards                   | `div[data-canvas-iframe][data-layout="card"] > iframe` (`platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?id=…`) |

### Recommended CSS (video + cards)

**Canvas UI:** already included via `ui/partials/embeds.blade.php` (no copy-paste needed).

**Custom frontend:** you do **not** need the full admin stylesheet. Minimal public CSS is the same rules as that partial — 16:9 for `div[data-youtube-video]` / `[data-layout="video"]`, max-width ~550px for `[data-layout="card"]`, responsive images. Wrap body HTML in a root with class `canvas-post-body` (or map the selectors to your own class). See the partial for the full ruleset.

### X / Twitter height (required for full cards)

Cross-origin tweet iframes **do not** expand with CSS alone. Portrait and media-heavy posts look cropped until something applies the height Twitter reports via `postMessage`.

**Canvas UI (included):** `resources/views/ui/partials/embeds.blade.php` ships CSS for video/cards plus a small inline resize listener. The show template wraps body HTML in `.canvas-post-body`. After `php artisan canvas:ui`, embeds work with no extra assets.

**Admin SPA:** the same behavior lives in `resources/js/lib/posts/iframe-resize.ts`.

**Custom frontend:** reuse that pattern (or copy the partial’s script) after injecting body HTML. Without resize JS, stored markup is still valid but X cards stay short.

### Media URLs

Uploads use `config('canvas.storage_disk')` and `storage_path` (defaults: `public` disk, `canvas/` prefix). Bodies and featured images often store **root-relative** paths like `/storage/canvas/…` so they work across hosts. `canvas:install` runs `storage:link` for you; if you skipped install or use a custom disk/CDN, ensure that path is linked or served. Helpers such as `Canvas\Support\MediaUrl` / `PostSeo` expand to absolute URLs when needed (e.g. Open Graph, webhooks).

### XSS and sanitization

- Titles, summaries, tag names: always escape (`{{ }}`).
- Body: HTML from trusted editors. If you re-expose body through a **public write API** later, sanitize. For classic Canvas (admin-only writes), unescaped body is expected.
- Do not run arbitrary scripts from body; the editor does not intend to store `<script>`.

---

## Admin JSON API (SPA, not public)

Base URL: `/{canvas.path}/api` (default `/canvas/api`).

Middleware stack (package routes):

- `config('canvas.middleware')` (default `web`)
- `auth:{canvas.guard}`
- Canvas user eager-load + **Authorize** (must have a `canvas_users` row / access)

Expect **session cookies** and CSRF for mutating requests, same as a normal Laravel SPA — not a public bearer-token API.

### Posts (high level)

| Method   | Path                  | Notes                                                        |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | `/posts`              | Paginated list; `?type=draft` vs published; counts           |
| `GET`    | `/posts/create`       | Empty post shell + tag/topic catalogs                        |
| `GET`    | `/posts/{id}`         | Full post payload for the editor                             |
| `POST`   | `/posts/{id}`         | Create/update (UUID in path); `promote`, `publish_now` flags |
| `POST`   | `/posts/{id}/discard` | Clear `pending`, keep live snapshot                          |
| `GET`    | `/posts/{id}/stats`   | Insights (published only)                                    |
| `DELETE` | `/posts/{id}`         | Soft delete                                                  |

List responses hide the full `pending` blob but expose `has_pending_changes`. Detail responses include editor fields the SPA needs.

Other authenticated prefixes: `media`, `tags`, `topics`, `users`, `stats`, `search`, `integrations`, `unsplash`, `ai/rewrite`, `translations/{locale}`.

**Do not** use these endpoints as your public blog API. Build a thin host controller or Inertia/Livewire/Next data layer on Eloquent instead. That keeps auth, caching, and response shape under your control.

---

## Webhooks (event-driven headless)

Configure in **Admin → Integrations → Webhooks**. Lifecycle events (publish, schedule, update, unpublish, delete) POST signed JSON to your HTTPS URL. Payloads include metadata (slug, title, summary, featured image, SEO meta, topic/tags, author) — **not** the full HTML body.

Typical flow:

1. Receive `post.published` / `post.updated`
2. Fetch full post in your app (`Post::published()->where('slug', …)` or by id)
3. Revalidate cache / rebuild static page / purge CDN

See [.github/UPGRADE.md](../../.github/UPGRADE.md) (Webhooks section) for event ids, signature verification (`Canvas-Signature`), and queue requirements.

---

## Roles and access

Canvas access is a row in `canvas_users` linked to your host user model.

| Role        | Intent                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contributor | Write/manage own posts (publish rules depend on policies) |
| Editor      | Broader post access                                       |
| Admin       | Users, taxonomy, integrations, full access                |

Grant access: `php artisan canvas:make-admin you@example.com` (and related role commands as documented in the main readme / upgrade notes). Host auth (login/logout) stays yours; Canvas only checks “is this authenticated user a Canvas user?”

---

## Configuration touchpoints

Relevant `config/canvas.php` keys for frontends and hosts:

| Key                             | Default             | Relevance                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `path`                          | `canvas`            | Admin SPA mount                  |
| `domain`                        | `null`              | Optional admin subdomain         |
| `user_model`                    | `App\Models\User`   | Author relation                  |
| `guard`                         | `web`               | Auth guard for admin             |
| `storage_disk` / `storage_path` | `public` / `canvas` | Media URLs in body               |
| `middleware`                    | `['web']`           | Extra middleware on admin routes |

Reader routes from `canvas:ui` are **host** routes (`web` middleware); they do not use the Canvas admin path prefix.

---

## Custom frontend recipes

### Blade (customize Canvas UI)

1. `php artisan canvas:ui`
2. Edit `app/Http/Controllers/Canvas/CanvasUiController.php`
3. Publish or override views under `resources/views/vendor/canvas/ui`
4. Keep `Post::published()`, SEO helper, and `PostViewed` unless you replace analytics

### Laravel API for a separate SPA (Next, Nuxt, mobile)

```php
// routes/api.php — example, you own this
Route::get('/blog/posts', function () {
    return Post::published()
        ->select(['id', 'slug', 'title', 'summary', 'featured_image', 'published_at', 'user_id', 'topic_id'])
        ->with(['topic:id,name,slug', 'user:id,name'])
        ->latest()
        ->paginate(10);
});

Route::get('/blog/posts/{slug}', function (string $slug) {
    $post = Post::published()
        ->with(['tags:name,slug', 'topic:id,name,slug', 'user:id,name'])
        ->firstWhere('slug', $slug) ?? abort(404);

    return [
        'post' => $post,
        'seo' => PostSeo::resolve($post, url("/blog/{$slug}")),
    ];
});
```

Never expose `pending` or host user secrets. Expand media URLs if the SPA is on another origin.

### Static / SSG

On webhook `post.published` / `post.updated`, rebuild the page for that slug. On `post.unpublished` / `post.deleted`, remove it. Poll `Post::published()` if you do not use webhooks.

## What Canvas UI is (and is not)

**Is**

- A publishable starter so you can read posts without inventing routing
- An example of correct Eloquent usage, SEO meta, RSS, and view tracking
- Optional and fully overwritable in the host app

**Is not**

- Required for Canvas to work
- A theming system or multi-tenant public CMS
- A substitute for designing your product’s frontend
- The place where “real” content lives (the database is)

---

## Checklist for a solid headless integration

- [ ] Query with `Post::published()` (and friends); ignore `pending` on the public side
- [ ] Escape non-HTML fields; render `body` as HTML intentionally
- [ ] Serve `/storage` (or your disk) for images in body and featured image
- [ ] Style embeds; size X cards with resize JS
- [ ] Use `PostSeo` (or equivalent) for meta tags
- [ ] Fire `PostViewed` if you want Canvas stats
- [ ] Prefer webhooks + Eloquent over scraping the admin API
- [ ] Keep Canvas UI or delete the routes if unused — no half-linked stubs in production
